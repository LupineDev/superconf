    <p>When he isn’t ruining people’s lives by writing software like
    phuby, enterprise, and neversaydie, Aaron can be found writing
    slightly more useful software like nokogiri. To keep up his
    Gameboy Lifestyle, Aaron spends his weekdays writing high
    quality software for ATTi. Be sure to catch him on Karaoke night,
    where you can watch him sing his favorite smooth rock hits of the

    <div class='name'>Mark Bates</div>
    <div class='session'>TBA</div>
    <p>Mark Bates has been developing web applications of one kind or another since 1996. He has spent an ungodly amount of time programming Java, but thankfully he discovered Ruby in late 2005, and life has been much nicer since. In 2011 Mark found CoffeeScript and his life got even nicer</p>
    <p>Since discovering Ruby Mark has become a prominent member of the community. He has developed various open source projects such as Configatron, Cachetastic, CoverMe, and the Mack Framework. In 2009 Mark authored the book “Distributed Programming with Ruby” for Addison-Wesley.</p>
    <p>Since discovering CoffeeScript in 2011 Mark has become a leader in that community as well, through presentations at local user groups to releasing several high profile libraries, such as Deano.JS and CoffeeBeans. Mark is currently working on the book “Programming in CoffeeScript” for Addison-Wesley (due out in early 2012).</p>
    <p>Mark has taught classes on both Ruby and Ruby on Rails. He has spoken at several Ruby gatherings, including 2008 and 2010’s RubyConf where Mark spoke about building distributed applications. Mark has also given presentations about CoffeeScript at several gatherings, including BostonRB.</p>
    <p>In 2011 Mark launched the innovative applications <a href="http://FluxTracker.com">FluxTracker.com</a> (integrated issue, project, and error tracking) and <a href="http://TweetKO.com">TweetKO.com</a> (bookmark and backup tweets).</p>
    <p>Mark has an honors degree in Music from the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. He still likes to rock out on the weekends, but set times are now 10PM and not 2AM.</p>
    <p>He lives just outside of Boston with his wife Rachel and their sons Dylan and Leo.</p>
    <p>Mark can be found at <a href="http://www.markbates.com">www.markbates.com</a> and <a href="http://github.com/markbates">github.com/markbates</a>.</p>

    <div class='name'>James Edward Gray</div>
    <div class='session'>Ten Things You Didn't Know Ruby Could Do</div>
    <p>James Edward Gray II (@JEG2) was a Rubyist before it was cool to be one; that's before Rails shipped. He has been involved in almost every aspect of the Ruby community at some point from writing code and documentation to running conferences. These days you can catch him as a regular on the Ruby Rogues podcast. He also enjoys speaking at Ruby conferences, so that he has an excuse to go see places like Hawaii.</p>
